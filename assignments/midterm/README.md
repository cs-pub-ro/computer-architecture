# MIDTERM AB

This directory contains the midterm assignment for the Computer Architecture course. The assignment focuses on understanding and implementing Moore Finite State Machines (FSMs) and analyzing logic gate truth tables.

## Contents
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the midterm assignment.
- `moore_fsm/`: Contains the implementation of a Moore FSM along with a fetch script to simulate the FSM based on given input sequences.
- `table_output/`: Contains solutions related to logic gate truth tables and their analysis.
- `gate_table/`: Contains truth table data for various logic gates used in the assignment.
